                    I began my journey into computer science at Simon Fraser University in September 2013 right after my high school graduation. I didn't know what to expect as a computer science student since I have never done any programming prior to university. After some time getting used to programming, solving mind-boggling problems, and a couple of all-nighters, I'm really happy that I chose to pursue this field of study. Currently, I am in the last year of my degree and will be finishing up my courses this upcoming summer in mid-August 2019.
                    <br><br>
                    I spent my second year of university studying abroad at Zhejiang University in Hangzhou, China. I've lived in Vancouver my whole life, so this was a very eye-opening experience. I had the opportunity to work with students from different cultural backgrounds, explore the country, and also improve my Chinese at the same time. Being raised by my parents, who immigrated from China, and speaking Chinese regularly at home, I was able to fit in to the new environment rather quickly.

                    In January 2018, I started my second co-op job as a firmware engineer at Intel NSG (Non-Volatile Memory Solutions Group) in Vancouver, BC, Canada. I was part of the 3D-XPoint team where I had the opportunity to work on the next generation Optane solid state drives. For the next 8 months, I developed firmware in C, created and improved unit tests for new features to ensure corner cases were exercised, and ported bug fixes from previous generation firmware to interface with new hardware. I also developed a software tool in Python with a GUI that takes in various configurations to generate a visualization of the Optane solid state drive data layout for engineers to debug firmware.

                    In January 2017, I started my first co-op job as a software engineer at Sierra Wireless in Richmond, BC, Canada. I was in the software development team that worked on AirPrime cellular modules. During my time there, I developed APIs in C++, analyzed defects, and fixed bugs. I implemeted new functionalities in the product's test application to test corner cases and validate new features. I also investigated new features using Microsoft Azure and mobile device management solutions to develop new capabilities for the AirPrime modules.

                    In the fall semester of 2018, I took a course called CMPT 470 (Web-Based Information Systems). We had to form groups of 4 to 6 students and come up with a project idea for a web application that solves a real-world problem. For our problem, we noticed the inconvenience of sharing and listening to music together with friends remotely. Hence, my group, consisting of 6 students, decided to develop a web applcation that allows users to create and join sessions to listen to synchronized music, and chat online. Users must have a Spotify premium account in order to access all the features.
                    <br><br>
                    For this project, we utilized the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture, LEMP (Laravel, Nginx, MySQL, PHP) stack, Vue.js, and Bootstrap to create our dynamic website. We interfaced with the Spotify Web API to add user authentication, fetch music data, implement a search bar to search for songs, and to create a music player. We also used the service, Pusher, to broadcast chat messages and synchronize music among users in real-time within a session.

                    In the fall semester of 2016, I took a project-based course called CMPT 276 (Introduction to Software Engineering), where the entire semester was focused on developing a single project in a group of 5 students.
                    <br><br>
                    For our project, we created a japanese chess game called Shogi. The code was written in a programming language called Julia. We developed a GUI for this application, and implemented artificial intelligence. Users can either play against another human player or an AI, which had multiple difficulties. We used the minimax search with alpha-beta pruning algorithm to implement the AI.

                        In the fall semester of 2017, I took a course called CMPT 300 (Operating Systems). In this course, I had to write a program to solve a variation of the Bounded-Buffer Problem (also known as the Producer-Consumer Problem) with various constraints on resources. To solve this problem, I developed a multithreaded program written in C using pthreads and seamphores. In order to avoid deadlock and race conditions, I applied a mutex to lock the critical sections when a thread accessed any shared resources.
